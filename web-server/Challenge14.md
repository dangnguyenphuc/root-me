## Solution

1. Read the hint: Do you know phpBB?
2. Go to the target URL
3. Nothing display on browser
4. So, what do we do now ?? I think we should read some blogs about phpBB now :))
5. First, i search for the source code directory (ref above)
6. Then i find out that the challenge title match with the "install" directory
7. Go to the url: http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch6/phpbb/install/
8. It will list all the files, and there is just 1 file: install.php
9. Click on that file and get your password :)
